# GISPLS

## Welcome to GISPLS!
The goal of this pipeline is to enhance the application of the GGEPLS approach to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for predicting Genotype x Environment interaction (GxE). If you're interested, this repository contains the main script (GIS_PLS_en.R or GIS_PLS_ptbr.R) with all the necessary instructions to conduct the analysis using inventory data (production sites). The pipeline functions were designed to make the approach user-friendly, even for those without a strong background in GIS. However, if you do happen to have prior knowledge of GIS, please let us know so we can adapt the instructions to be as didactic as possible.

## Inventory data
The provided data shows standardized predictions of the Mean Annual Increment (MAI) of wood at 7 years old, based on productive eucalyptus sites across major regions of Brazil.

## Environmental data
The GISPLS approach is a versatile tool that can handle various types of environmental data. Our pipeline consists of two functions, "get_WC" and "get_SG", which can quickly provide rasters from WorldClim and SoilGrids at four different spatial resolutions: 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 2.5 minutes, and 30 seconds.
